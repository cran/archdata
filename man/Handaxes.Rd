The data consist of measurements on 600 handaxes from the Furze Platt site stored at the Royal Ontario Museum that were measured by William Fox. The measurements follow the system used by Derek Roe (Roe 1964, 1968, 1981). Fox's measurements were digitized and by Tony Baker and uploaded to his website.
