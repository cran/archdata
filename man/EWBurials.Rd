\details{
The Ernest Witte site in Austin County, Texas contains four burial groups from different time periods. Group 1 includes 60 interments and that occurred between about 2000 and 1200 BCE.  Group 2 is the largest with 148 interments. The burials in this group were interred between about CE 200 and 500. Groups 3 and 4 include only 10 and 13 interments and date to CE 500 to 1500, but are not included in this data set which was taken from Appendix II (Hall 1981). Two of the variables, \code{direction} and \code{looking}, are circular data and require package \code{circular}. Hall (2010) provides a summary of the site and its significance.
