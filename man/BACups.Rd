\usage{data("BACups")}
\format{
  A data frame with 60 observations on the following 6 variables.
  \describe{
    \item{\code{RD}}{Rim Diameter}
    \item{\code{ND}}{Neck Diameter}
    \item{\code{SD}}{Shoulder Diameter}
    \item{\code{H}}{Total Height}
    \item{\code{NH}}{Neck Height}
    \item{\code{Phase}}{Chronological Phase: Protoapennine, Subapennine}
  }
}
\details{
These data on the dimensions of Bronze Age cups from Italy are a subset extracted from a set published by Lukesh and Howe  (1978) of the specimens for which full data was available. The data were scanned from Table A4 (Appendix A) in Baxter (1994). The Protoapennine cups are Early Bronze Age while the Subapennine cups are Late Bronze Age.
