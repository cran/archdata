\details{
The data on counts of 52 different ceramic types in 6 large tombs and 10 broadly contemporaneous groups of tombs come from Tell el-Far'ah (South), Palestine. They were originally published in McClellan (1979).  The data were scanned from Table 2.5 in Baxter (2003, p. 25-6). The 52 rows correspond to different pottery types found in association with the burials.
