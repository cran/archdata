\usage{data(Nelson)}
\format{
  A data frame with 10 observations on the following 8 variables.
  \describe{
    \item{\code{Depth}}{Depth in feet from 1 to 10 for 1 foot arbitrary excavation levels}
    \item{\code{Corrugated}}{Number of corrugated ware ceramics}
    \item{\code{Biscuit}}{Number of Biscuit ware ceramics}
    \item{\code{Type_I}}{Number of two and three color painted ware ceramics}
    \item{\code{Type_II_Red}}{Number of two color glazed red ware ceramics}
    \item{\code{Type_II_Yellow}}{Number of two color glazed yellow ware ceramics}
    \item{\code{Type_II_Gray}}{Number of two color glazed gray ware ceramics}
    \item{\code{Type_III}}{Number of three color glazed ware ceramics}

\details{
Data from a classic illustration of the potential for creating a relative chronology using frequency seriation of ceramic artifact types from a midden deposit at San Cristobal in the American Southwest. The site was occupied approximately from CE 1350 to 1680. Ceramic artifact fragment counts are presented for each 1-foot arbitrary level excavated within the midden deposit. When converted to percentages (usually excluding the corrugated ware), the data illustrate a classical "battleship curve" like those described in Ford (1962).
